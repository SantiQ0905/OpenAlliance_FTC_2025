# **Post-Monterrey Regional Learnings and Improvements**

## **ðŸŸ£ Overture Purple**

- Most of the **post-regional development** focused on implementing a similar redesign for the **intake/grabber** on "Diavel," inspired by the improved grabbing performance on "Valkyrie."
- We integrated an **articulated claw mechanism** to enhance control and adaptability.
- Improved **PID tuning** for both the **elevator and arm**, ensuring more precise movement and control.
- Added **push-buttons** for **encoder reset**, allowing the **elevator and arm** to recalibrate efficiently.
- Developed a **new autonomous routine for Chamber placement**, expanding our scoring capabilities.
- **Driver practice** took center stage, along with **Inspire Award preparation**, refining our ability to communicate our teamâ€™s impact and engineering process effectively before the Championship.
- Unfortunatley a day before we travelled our robot suffered heavy mechanical damage that included a broken claw and the derailment of our GoBilda Elevator. So practice was cut short to ensure mechanical fidelity for the Championship.

## **âšª Overture White**

- Post-regional development focused heavily on **programming enhancements**.
- Implemented and refined a **Chamber placement command** for both chambers, ensuring more precise execution.
- Developed **new pickup commands** for the **Specimen**, allowing for collection at two different angles depending on the driverâ€™s orientation.
- Programmed a **new autonomous sequence for Chamber placement** and refined our existing **High Basket autonomous routine**.
- Dedicated time to **driver practice** and further **Inspire Award preparation**, ensuring we entered the Championship with strong technical and communication skills.

## **ðŸšŒ Traveling to Mexico City for the Championship**

Due to the proximity of our first **FRC event**, the **Regional Monterrey by PrepaTec**, we had to plan our trip strategically. To optimize team participation while managing resources efficiently, we sent **6 team members per team**, totaling **12 students**, accompanied by **3 mentors** and **one head coach**.

We were fortunate to travel alongside our friends from **Botbusters**, who made space for us on their coach. The journey was an incredible experience filled with excitement, collaboration, and camaraderie. **A huge thank you to Botbusters** for their generosity and for making the trip even more memorable! ðŸš€ðŸ’œâšª
