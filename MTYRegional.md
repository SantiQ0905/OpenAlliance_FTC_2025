# **Monterrey Regional**

### **üü£ 23619 Overture Purple**

- Robot name: "Diavel" inspired by The DUCATI Diavel Motorcycle.
- Due to time and practice constraints, we settled for climbing only the first level, ensuring more High Basket cycles.
- The claw mechanism had a fixed angle, prioritizing consistency over variability.
- We developed an autonomous routine for each starting location, guaranteeing at least two high basket samples.
- We held practice matches at our workshop against our teams, complementing each other‚Äôs strategies and driving improvements.
- Most of the final days before our first event were focused on optimizing fast High and Low basket cycles, enabling efficient grabbing from any section of the submersible.
- At the event, we carried on with our new **"BELIEVE" philosophy**, inspired by *Ted Lasso*, and hung a **"BELIEVE"** poster in our pit, which was signed by all team members.
- In preparation, we extensively practiced our **Inspire presentation** and **pit questions**, covering everything from team culture to detailed engineering explanations.
- We trained new members on pit operations and event workflow, ensuring that first-time attendees gained valuable hands-on experience.
- **Performance Summary:**
  - **Rank:** #24
  - **Record:** 1-4-0
  - **OPR:** 39.73
  - Selected as a partner of **Alliance Seed 4** with **VOLTEC Robotics Black**.
  - Advanced through the **Playoffs**, eliminated in **Lower Bracket Round 4 (Match 8)**.
